          Hi there! My name is Zeeshan and I'm a high schooler who is obsessed with programming and
          cybersecurity. I am known to beat my keyboard until some useful bit of code comes up
          eventually.
        </p>

          But don't let my love for computers fool you ‚Äì I'm a total dork at heart. I love cracking
          jokes (even if they're only funny to me) and making people laugh. I'm also a huge fan of
          memes and puns, so if you're into that kind of thing, we'll definately get along.
        </p>
        <p className="prose max-w-none pb-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-400">
          So why am I sharing all of this with you? Well, I started this blog to document my journey
          as a programmer and to share my thoughts and experiences with others. Whether you're a
          fellow programmer or just someone who is interested in the tech world, I hope you'll find
          something here that resonates with you. Thanks for stopping by!
