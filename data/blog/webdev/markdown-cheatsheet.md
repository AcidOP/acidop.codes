Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting and styling text. It is simple to learn and easy to use, making it a popular choice for creating content for the web. Whether you are a blogger, a content creator, or just someone who wants to format text quickly, Markdown is an excellent choice. In this blog post, we will provide you with the only Markdown cheatsheet you will ever need.

# Headings

Headings are used to organize and structure text. Markdown supports six levels of headings, from H1 to H6.

```markdown
# H1 (Largest)
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6 (Smallest)
```

# Emphasis

To add emphasis to your text, you can use bold, italic, or strikethrough formatting.

```markdown
**bold**
*italic*
~~strikethrough~~
```

# Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. To create an ordered list, use numbers, and to create an unordered list, use asterisks, pluses, or hyphens.

```md
# Ordered List
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

# Unordered List
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

# Links

Links allow you to include hyperlinks in your text. To create a link, use the following syntax:

```markdown
[Link text](URL)
```

# Images

Markdown also supports the inclusion of images. To add an image, use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Image Alt](URL)
```

# Code Blocks

If you need to include code in your text, Markdown supports code blocks and inline code. To create a code block, use three backticks (\`) before and after your code. To create inline code, use a single backtick (\`) before and after your code.

```javascript
# SingleLine Code
 `console.log("Follow me")`

# Multiline Code
    ```javascript
    
    function printer(text) {
	    console.log(text);
    }
    
    printer("AcidOP on top")
    /```
```


# Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, use the greater than symbol (>) before your text.

```markdown
> Quote here
```

# Horizontal Rules

To create a horizontal rule, use three hyphens (---), asterisks (***), or underscores (___).

```markdown
---
# Or
***
# Or
___
```

# Tables

Markdown also supports the creation of tables. To create a table, use the following syntax:

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 | Row 1, Column 3 |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 | Row 2, Column 3 |
```
