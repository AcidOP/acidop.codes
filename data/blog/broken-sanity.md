## No this article is not about [sanity.io](https://sanity.io). <br/>
### This is about **me**.


Everything was so overwhelming at first. I learnt [react](https://reactjs.org) at first for the sake of single page applications. Then I came to know how it was so bad for SEO. Then I moved to [next.js](https://nextjs.org) for it's SSR and other features.

Although I have built my ([now previous](https://portfolio-website-tawny-xi.vercel.app/)) website using NextJS and Bootstrap, I was not satisfied with how it turned out to be. I wanted to build something which had more overall features.

I found out that all *cool kids* now use something called [remix](https://remix.run) and decided to go with it for the next version of my website. I built it within a week using remix and tailwindcss. It looked enchanting. You can check it out [here](https://remix-blog-2jxu.vercel.app/).

But for some weird reason I decided to not use it as my main website. But with the upcoming board exams I could not give much time to it. So this time I forked the [repo](https://github.com/Cwarcup/personal-blog) of Curtis and bootstrapped the project. I am using this as my main site for now. In future I will most probably customise it more to my likings.

This entire journey had been enjoyably stressful. I took multiple breaks, passed through multiple Burnouts, changed my tech stack so many times but finally it is done. I am happy with it.
