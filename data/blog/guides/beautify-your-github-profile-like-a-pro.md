[GitHub](https://github.com) is a code-sharing platform that provides developers a platform to showcase their coding skills, expertise and build an impressive online presence. It is important to keep your GitHub profile up-to-date and visually appealing. Here are some tips to help you beautify your GitHub profile like a pro!

# Add a ReadMe

The ReadMe is the first thing people see when they visit your profile. So, make sure you add one that gives a clear idea of who you are and what you do.

To create a ReadMe for your profile you need to create a repo with your username as the repo name. For example if your username is [AcidOP](https://github.com/AcidOP) then you must name the repo as `AcidOP`.

# Use your creativity

Now if the perfect time to learn some [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and put it to good use. You can also use html for this step but I would suggest putting the time to learn markdown and use the same.

Now this is your place to shine. Use your creative ideas to create the best possible profile according to you. You can insert images and badges to make it more aesthetic.

Pro tip: You can ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat): *"Some tips for writing an aesthetic Github profile"*

**I will add my 2 cents:**

* Keep it concise and to the point
* Use relevant images or gifs to make it more engaging
* Add links to your best projects and social media profiles

# Pin Best Repositories

Pinning your best repositories at the top of your profile makes them more visible to visitors. This gives them a quick insight into your coding skills and expertise.

Choose the ones that are your best projects so far or the ones that you are most proud of. You can also pin your most recent projects to keep your profile updated.

# Contribute

Contribution is the key to building a strong presence on GitHub. It shows that you are an active member of the developer community and are passionate about coding. Through contributing you will not only add more to the open source community but also increase your network. **But remember to keep it authentic**.

Here are some ways you can contribute:

* Find repositories that need help
* Add more to the libraries you already use
* Create your own open source project
* Report bugs and suggest improvements

# Good GitHub Bio Section

The GitHub bio section is a brief introduction about yourself that appears at the top of your profile. It is important to keep it simple yet engaging. 

Here are some tips to write a good bio:

* Use keywords that describe your skills and expertise
* Mention your current job title or what you are studying
* Add a touch of humor to make it more interesting

<br />

**Additional Pro tips:**

* You can get the Github Pro Highlight for free if you are a student. Apply for [Student Developer Pack](https://developer.github.com/program/)
* Keep stacking [Achievements](https://github.com/sagelga/github-achievement-cheatsheet). Definately a plus point.
* Join the [Developer Program](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-integrations/github-developer-program). You get another highlight.
* [Create an organisation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch). (Better to keep it legit though)
