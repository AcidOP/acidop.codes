# Hello World!

It's your boy Zeeshan here (aka **Acid**). 

Just an average 17 year old Indian, except I have the programming skills of a college graduate and a *love* for the 80's that would make Metallica blush. 😊

I know what you're thinking: "Isn't he too young to be so tech-savvy?".
Well, age is just a number, my friends. And besides, I've been coding for **over 3 years** now, so I'm practically a veteran.

I am also the Co Founder of a startup (I'll make a post soon) where I'm responsible for the backend and the frontend and since I'm also a cybersecurity geek, I also do pentesting for the company.

I also happen to be a failed music producer 🤧. I tried making music using FL Studio but failed at it miserably but it is something I want to do once I have more resources. Music is the programming of soul right?
